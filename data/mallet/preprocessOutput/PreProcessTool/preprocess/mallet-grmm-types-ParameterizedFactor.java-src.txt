types a factor that supports taking derivatives respect to its continuous variables example a gaussian factor can support derivatives respect to its mean and precision $ parameterized factor v 1 1 2007 10 22 21 37 44 exp $ parameterized factor factor computes expected derivative log factor value that <pre>sum y q y dlog f y d theta<pre> where y are outcomes discrete varables in factor f y factor value and theta vector continuous variables in factor q a user specified to take expectation respect to <p> factor q specifies variables to sum over summation will be over all variables in <tt>q var set < tt> and rest variables will be used <p> q to take respect to need not be normalized <tt>q var set < tt> should be all variables factor except one continuous variable parameter to take gradient respect to expected gradient sum grad log factor q variable assignment assn
